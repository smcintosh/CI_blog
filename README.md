# There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Build

Modern software is developed at a frantic pace. Last May (2015), Mozilla processed [8,363 updates to the codebase](http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.ca/2015/06/mozilla-pushes-may-2015.html) (roughly 270 updates per day!) The widespread adoption of techniques like continuous delivery accelerates the rate at which these changes become visible to users. Indeed, Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook release [several times daily][1].

# Builds Take Time to Execute

# Builds Consume Computational Resources
